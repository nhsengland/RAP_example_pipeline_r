# README
Artificial data sets provide users with large volumes of data that share some of the characteristics of real data while protecting patient confidentiality. 

Artificial data represents the formatting, structure and volume of the original data set. It does not preserve relationships between fields and it is not possible to use artificial data to reidentify individuals.

## Why this data is safe to share
Records in artificial data relate to fictitious patients, so not constitute personal data under UK GDPR.

There are 2 steps to generate artificial data:

1. The ?metadata scraper? creates a national level, aggregated, anonymous summary of the real data.
1. The ?data generator? randomly samples from the anonymous aggregates to generate artificial data. 

Between these 2 steps, the anonymous aggregates are reviewed and signed-off via a process agreed with our chief statistician and Statistical Disclosure Control Panel, in accordance with standard procedures for publishing statistics used across the organisation.

**Image description:**
This diagram shows how data generation is completely isolated from the aggregation, with a review and sign off process separating the 2 steps. 

1. Boxes on the left with a blue dashed border represent different scopes where real data is accessed. 1. Within each scope, only a single data set is accessible and is completely isolated from other data sets.
1. Data flows from left to right through the metadata scraper to produce anonymous aggregates for each data set.
1. The red box to the right of centre represents the disclosure control process which has been agreed with our chief statistician and Statistical Disclosure Control Panel. Aggregate data is blocked from exiting the scope where it was created if the checks are not passed.
1. Once all checks are passed, the data flows to the circle on the right of the image which represents the data generator.
1. Finally, anonymous artificial data sets flow out of the data generator to be safely shared with users.

The [artificial data generator](https://github.com/NHSDigital/artificial-data-generator) uses aggregate, anonymised data to randomly create artificial records. Statistical relationships between columns are not preserved, meaning that individual records are not an accurate representation of individual real records. Any attempt to reverse engineer the artificial data generator would only yield the aggregate statistics on which the artificial data is based.

For example, each artificial record in a data set which contains records describing genders, ages, ICD 10 diagnoses, appointment dates and times, would be generated by randomly picking a value for each field independently and then putting these together to form a ?complete record?. Most records generated in such a way would be unrealistic, since there is unlikely to be record-level integrity. For example, artificial patient records may have ?geriatrics? as the department being visited, and an age of 5 years old.

Only by coincidence would some artificial records resemble real records.

## How the data is generated
The artificial data generator randomly generates artificial data by sampling from anonymous univariate frequency distributions derived from real data.

**Image description:** The diagram illustrates the main steps and outputs in creating the aggregates of real data and using them to generate artificial data.

- The diagram flows from top to bottom. The first box represents the original data set.
- Each column is aggregated independently by the metadata scraper in the second box (yellow).
- The third box shows the univariate frequency distributions created by the metadata scraper. Each field is completely independent, with no relationships are preserved in this aggregated data.
- The fourth box (red) represents the disclosure control process, which ensures that the aggregate data is non-identifiable.
- The fifth box (green) represents the step which generates the data. Anonymous aggregates flow into this process to independently generate fields in the artificial data. Post processing is applied to make the artificial records appear more realistic.
- Finally, the generated fields are combined to form ?complete records?.

### Aggregation and anonymisation
The original data is aggregated on a column-by-column basis, with each column treated independently. The outputs of this stage are frequency tables of unique values in each column. At this stage key identifiers (such as patient ID) are removed and small numbers are suppressed to prevent reidentification at a later stage.

The aggregated data is anonymous. For example, the aggregates could be used to approximately could determine the number of female patients or how many 49 year olds there are in the real data, but not the number of 49 year old female patients, as each column is aggregated independently of the others.

### Random data generation
The aggregated data is used to randomly generate artificial data. Each column, for each record, is generated at random. For example, artificial records assigned a relatively low age may have a geriatric diagnosis code. This lack of record level realism ensures the artificial data is anonymous so that it cannot be used to reidentify individuals. It also means that it would not be possible to gain insights or build statistical models that would transfer onto real data.

Since the artificial data is generated using anonymised data, the artificial data itself is anonymous ? it only contains as much information as the anonymous aggregate statistics from which it is derived.

### Post processing
Once artificial data has been generated, some basic checks and rules are applied to make the data appear more realistic.

For example, randomly generated birth and death dates may be swapped to ensure sensible ordering.

Finally, randomly generated dummy values for identifying fields (such as ?patient? ID?) are added. These fields are generated based on template patterns structured to ensure unrealistic values with the correct properties (for example, data type and length).
